Chess Tracker
--------------

Author: Adam Plumb

This is a web application written for PHP/MySQL.

This application tracks the results of chess matches over a period of time between a group of players
with the goal of rating players with an Elo-like system used by the major chess federations.  It provides 
forms to add games and to add tournaments (to which games are attributed).  Once games are added, \
there are charts and graphs to look at which break things down statistically.

Note from the author:  I created this application quickly and for a single purpose, to track the chess
games I was playing with my co-workers.  It is Quick 'n Dirty (tm) and was never intended for public
consumption.  However, I was convinced to make the code public and so here it is!  Enjoy!

Install
-------

1. Import the database.sql file from the sql into your MySQL database.
2. In www/sql.php change the credentials to suit your environment.

Adding Players
--------------

There are forms to add games and tournaments but not to add players.  To do this you'll need to manually 
insert a row into the players db table with the appropriate information.  I would suggest using a tool
like phpmyadmin to make this easier.  But you can you the command-line if you like.  You'll want to use an insert statement like: INSERT INTO players (created, name) VALUES (now(), 'Adam Plumb');

Changing player names, game information, ratings, tournment information
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

There are no interfaces or forms for modifying information; this will need to be done manually via
MySQL.  Also, bear in mind that ratings for players are updated every time a game is added and can't be
easily changed back.  However, if someone is interested, it should be easy enough to write a function
to recalculate ratings from scratch.

I am making this code public and free to use or modify without having to notify me.
